## Writing The Script
**Script**

I have written a script including all the commands that I've used to generate gene features in the last assignment

**Script Link**

https://github.com/rmahib/Mahib852/blob/main/Assignment_4/Script.sh

I've found the following features after running the script

````
1. Genes: 559
2. Number of CDS: 10
````

I've added two more additional features to my script and those are mRNA and number of exons

````
1. mRNA: 0
2. Exons: 42
````
**Rewriting the Script Using Someone Else Data**

I've changed my script to run Martina's Data

**Link for the modified script**

https://github.com/rmahib/Mahib852/blob/main/Assignment_4/lupinus.sh

I've found the following results while running the script with Martina's Data

1. Exon: 200363
2. mRNA: 419831
3. Gene: 83616
4. CDS: 419831
5. rRNA:1041

There are slight difference in number but the data is reproducible using the script and changing the variables

# Sequence ontology

**EXON**

A region of the transcript sequence within a gene which is not removed from the primary RNA transcript by RNA splicinge RNA product and codes for proteins

**Parent Term**

transcript_region

**Children's nodes**

1. decayed_exon
2. exon_of_single_exon_gene
3. interior_exon
4. coding_exon
5. exon_region
6. noncoding_exon
7. pseudogenic_exon

**Discussion**

Exons are crucial for gene expression as they represent the coding parts of a gene that are translated into proteins. Understanding their hierarchical relationships helps in comprehending the structure and function of genes
